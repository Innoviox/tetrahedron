# tetrahedron

The goal of this project was to develop a reinforcement-learning algorithm to solve the Rubix Tetrahedron. 



My attempts proved unsuccessful because my networks are not smart.



## Attempted Algorithms

keras-rl dqn

​	modifying: memory size, memory window length, policy

## Attempted Environment Settings

Evaluation: correct / total (36)

Evaluation: 1 if over threshold, 0 if not

​	threshold values tried: 0.9, 0.8, 0.6

Actions including/not including corner

### Ideas

.25 * # solved sides
